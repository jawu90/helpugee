<h2>A community effort</h2>
<p>
	This project was initiated to help people in need for leaving their home country. A tiny group of
	like-minded people pitched this project at the "Bayerwald Hackathon" and was lucky to motivate
	people with the necessary competencies for developing the first prototype.
</p>
<p>
	But in order to continuously optimize helpugee, gather new input and be up to date with all
	information, we need your help!
</p>
<p>These are the ways in which you can support us:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Add new institutions and their services to the map</li>
	<li>Edit or delete outdated information within the map</li>
	<li>Spread the word! Maybe your friends and family have more information to share here?</li>
	<li>
		Help us to further develop helpugee, please <a href={PROJECT_BOARD_LINK} rel="external"
			>check our project board</a
		>.
	</li>
	<li>
		Donate to our fundraising campaign that helps cover running infrastructure costs. The link will
		be provided at a later stage.
	</li>
</ul>
